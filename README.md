# An online facsimile edition of the Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew Lexicon



Since no complete open source edition of the Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew Lexicon (BDB) exists, this site serves as a first step toward that goal. While not every word is attested in the index, evey *root* is. So, even if you can't find the word you're looking for in the navigation sidebars, clicking on the closest tiem should get you close (probably to the right page). 

The page images are served via [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) using [Cantaloupe](https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/) hosted on an underpowered Digital Ocean Droplet. Sorry.
